Since we're using UPos tags (as opposed to treebank), we need to convert it using a space delimited file in `data/misc/pos-conversion-table.{lang}`. The information of conversion for english to upos can be found in [UD website](https://universaldependencies.org/tagset-conversion/en-penn-uposf.html). There's also exist the conversion for another languages there.
